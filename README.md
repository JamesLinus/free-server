## Installation

* You need to obtain a HTTPS SSL Certificate before you install HTTP2/SPDY server. Generate one with [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) or get one for free from [StartSSL](https://www.startssl.com/?app=12).
* Note that you can't use self-signed SSL cert. It must be issued by third-party authorities thanks to Chrome HTTP2/SPDY SSL validation.

```bash
rm -f install-shadowsocks-spdy-ocserv.sh
wget --no-cache -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lanshunfang/free-server/master/install-shadowsocks-spdy-ocserv.sh
bash install-shadowsocks-spdy-ocserv.sh
```

Note that, the script could be redeployed/reinstalled on your Ubuntu without worries on losing any old Shadowsocks, HTTP2/SPDY and iPSec account or password.
It backs them up if found any before execute re-installation.

## More

* This script will add several crontab configurations to `/etc/cron.d` to monitor Shadowsocks / HTTP2 (nghttpx, squid) / Cisco AnyConnect VPN / demo web server service status.
* For more stability, both Shadowsocks and HTTP2/SPDY are running in multiple instances, one per user, not single process.
